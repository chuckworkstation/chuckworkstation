## üîç Vulnerability Management Projects

Projects focused on identifying and mitigating system weaknesses.

- **System, Port & Vulnerability Discovery with Nmap**  
  Used Nmap to discover open ports and services across hosts for vulnerability assessment.

- **Performing Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus**  
  Configured and ran scans using Nessus to identify CVEs across networked systems.

- **Password Cracking w/ John the Ripper and Hashcat**  
  Demonstrated brute-force and dictionary attacks on password hashes.

- **Application Control with AppLocker**  
  Configured Windows AppLocker to restrict executable access and prevent unauthorized app usage.

- **Build a Simple REST API**  
  Developed a basic REST API to test common web vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.

- **Mitre ATT&CK (Attack Navigator & DeTTECT)**  
  Mapped adversary behavior using ATT&CK Navigator and prioritized defensive coverage with DeTTECT.

- **Create a File Integrity Monitor**  
  Built a FIM to track unauthorized file changes and generate alerts.

## üö® Security Operations & Incident Response Projects

Projects focused on detection, monitoring, and incident handling.

- **Building Cyber Security Lab From Scratch**  
  Set up a virtual lab environment to simulate attacks and monitor responses.

- **Configure Active Directory in Azure VM**  
  Deployed AD on Azure to replicate enterprise identity environments.

- **Real-Time Threat Detection with Microsoft Sentinel**  
  Ingested logs and built custom KQL queries for real-time detection in Sentinel.

- **Sniffing Network Traffic with Wireshark/TCPdump**  
  Captured and analyzed packet-level data to identify suspicious activity.

- **Security Onion Lab Setup**  
  Deployed Security Onion for full packet capture, intrusion detection, and threat hunting.

- **Incident Response with Security Onion Cases**  
  Investigated alerts and created incident cases with event correlation and analysis.
