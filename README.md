# 🔐 Welcome to my Cybersecurity Lab Portfolio!

This repository highlights hands-on projects I've worked on, with a focus on:

-  🔐 Identity and Access Management (IAM)  
- ⚠️ Threat Hunting and Security Operations 
-  🛡️ Vulnerability Management

Each project is designed to enhance real-world skills and demonstrate the application of cybersecurity tools and techniques across different domains of defensive security. 

Explore practical labs, automation scripts, and simulated enterprise environments built to reinforce knowledge and prepare for real-world roles.
